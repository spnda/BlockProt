# BlockProt Config

# Load a language file from the plugins/BlockProt/ directory.
# You can create your own language files and edit existing ones.
# Translations can be missing from this file and will instead be loaded
# from an internal version of "translations_en.yml".
language_file: translations_en.yml

# The fallback translation when the translation was not found in the
# language_file specified above, and it was also missing from the resources
# within the .jar file. This should most likely never happen.
fallback_string: "Unknown translation"

# If this is true, we will copy and replace the translation files on
# each startup. This is so that when you should update this plugin, any
# new or updated translations are automatically copied and applied. If
# you want to modify and included translation file, you will have to make
# this false, it is however always recommended to make your own, custom file.
replace_translations: true

# If set to "true", anytime an admin joins the server, they will
# receive an in-game message if this plugin is outdated.
# If set to "false", no message will be sent but /blockprot update
# will still work.
notify_op_of_updates: false

# If set to "true", redstone will be automatically disallowed on every
# placed block, if the player has lock on place enabled.

# A list of world names the plugin should not be usable in.
# The case of each name is ignored.
# Useful for a mining-only world where a block should not be
# owned by anyone. For example:
#   - world_mining
#   - world_end
excluded_worlds: [ ]

# Setting this to 'false' will make every new player have
# their "lock on place" setting disabled. This will be by
# default set to 'true'.
# Note: This does NOT affect players who have previously
# played on the server.

# Setting this to 'true' will make "the public" a friend by
# default.
public_is_friend_by_default: false

# The maximum amount of blocks a player can lock. If removed
# or set to any negative value, this is interpreted as setting
# no limit.

# protect their blocks.
lock_hint_cooldown_in_seconds: 10

# This defines the minimum similarity percentage that a player name
# can have to the friend search query at which it still shows up. By
# default, this is 0.3, meaning only names that are less than 30% similar
# are shown in the friend search. To determine similarity, the levenshtein
# algorithm is used.
friend_search_similarity: 0.5

# If desired, you can disable the friends functionality entirely. This will
# no longer allow players to give other players access to their blocks, and
# current settings are ignored until re-activated.
