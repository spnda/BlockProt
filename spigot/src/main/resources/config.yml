# BlockProt Config

# Load a language file from the plugins/BlockProt/ directory.
# You can create your own language files and edit existing ones.
# Translations can be missing from this file and will instead be loaded
# from an internal version of "translations_en.yml".

# The fallback translation when the translation was not found in the
# language_file specified above, and it was also missing from the resources
# within the .jar file. This should most likely never happen.
fallback_string: "Unknown translation"

# If this is true, we will copy and replace the translation files on
# each startup. This is so that when you should update this plugin, any
# new or updated translations are automatically copied and applied. If
# you want to modify and included translation file, you will have to make
# this false, it is however always recommended to make your own, custom file.
replace_translations: true

# If set to "true", anytime an admin joins the server, they will

# algorithm is used.
